#Chapter 1: Project Introduction
#1.1 Project Objectives
The main goal of this project was to create a simple multi-player based party game in the Unity video game engine, 
akin to Mario Party for example.
The game has to have entertainment value. Have simple rules, be easy to follow and must be capable of being completed, 
the game must not be too difficult.
The main goals for the game are as follows
- There are a minimum of three players.
- One player controls an antagonist type character represented by a series of fire balls. These fireballs are lined up 
horizontally and vertically.
- The fireballs lined up vertically can only move from left to right, and the the fireballs lined up horizontally can 
only move up and down.
- Two or more players control the protagonist characters. It is their job to each try and survive the level for 60 seconds.
- It is the player controlling the antagonist's role to move the fireballs around in an attempt to kill the protagonist players.
- While it is the protagonists job to avoid these fireballs while also attempting to hinder the other player(s).
- There are pickups which can be collected at certain intervals throughout the level.
- One pickup is a shield which provides the player with invincibility for a short period of time from the fireballs.
- One pickup is a ice blast, which when picked up adds to an inventory and is used as a projectile to freeze the other
 player in place.
- There are two game over screens. One which displays when all protagonist are killed, and another which displays when a protagonist(s) survive for 60 seconds.

#1.2 Overview of Project
For the third year project I decided to develop a game within the Unity engine that would have multi-player elements to it.
When the game was completed it would be tested within the engine using Xbox controllers and the keyboard on the PC itself.

The game consists of a minimum of 3 players, one player controlling the antagonist represented by a series of fireballs, 
and at least two players controlling the protagonists consisting of the "Gravity Guys". The two players try so survive the level,
while also hindering the other players with pickups which can be collected throughout the level.

The project was originally supposed to be a group project, it eventually became an individual project. The project started out
as a group deciding what would be the best way to undergo research in how to develop this game? What type of a game would it be?
How could this game be developed into an easy to play, and most of all, a fun multi-player experience?

Research was started by looking at the Unity engine itself and previous games which have been developed in the engine 
and the capabilities shown
in these games and if it would be possible to implement these features into the game I was developing. More research was conducted
into multi-player player games in general, such as what makes them fun to play and how can you and your friends enjoy the 
experience as much as possible?


Also looked at was the issues that some of these games had, and how exactly could they be improved upon in the game that 
was being developed for this project. The final game would then hopefully be completed using the information gathered from
the conducted research. A demo of the project was displayed in December to show how the basics of how the game would work,
with a full working version being finished by the end of April.

#1.3 Overview of Report
Chapter 2 will contain the research which was conducted into the development of this game. Chapter 3 will contain an analysis
of how the game works and the features of the game. While in chapter 4 we will look at the code used to make all of this 
feasible.
