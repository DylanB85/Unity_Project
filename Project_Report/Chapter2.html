<h1 id="introduction">2.1 Introduction</h1>
<p>In this chapter I will present all the relevant research relating to the project that has been conducted. This includes research of the Unity engine, games developed in the engine and the history of multi-player video games and why are they so popular.</p>

<p>Almost every one on planet earth has probably come into contact with video games at some point in their life, whether it through playing them, watching someone else play them or even seeing a movie previously based off of a video game. Yes, it is impossible to avoid video games on modern society. But how exactly are video games made? How does what you interact with on screen from traversing through space, to saving your princess from castle to castle, to even playing a virtual sport without ever having to leave your house made possible? It's simple really, these are all made possible through the software frameworks which are video game engines. These engines are used to design the video games in which you play on your consoles, your PCs and even your mobile devices. These frameworks provide for you, the tools to make your video game such as, the physics of your game, the animations, the scripting and the AI. Popular video game engines include the Frostbite engine, the Unreal engine, and of course the Unity engine.</p>
<p>The Unity Engine was first announced in 2005 originally only to be used on Mac OS due to its popularity it has since been extended to 27 platforms such as Desktop, Games Consoles, Virtual Reality and even Smart Tv's. The popularity of the platform increased even more with the launch of Unity 5 in 2015 with more than 5 billion games developed in Unity downloaded in the third quarter of 2016 alone, with the technology being popular among developers more than any other third party game development software, with developers including the likes of Ubisoft, Square Enix, Warner Bros, Obsidian and even Coca Cola.</p>
<p>Many popular games in today's gaming culture have been developed in Unity including the likes of, Slender: The Eight Pages, a popular survival horror game in which a player must collect eight pages scattered throughout a map all while avoiding someone who is following them. 7 Days to Die, another survival horror game set in an open world where the player must craft and survive in the wilderness while fighting against zombies. Cities Skylines, a simulator in which the user builds entire cities and the rules in which the city operates, and recently the extremely popular mobile game Pokemon GO was developed in Unity, a game in which you walk around with your phone and then encounter Pokemon and use the camera in your phone to capture them.</p>
<p>All of this shows that there are many different features in which can be implemented into games made using thus engine and just how creative a developer can be when developing a game which is one the goals of my project was to try make the game as creative as possible.</p>
